Overview

This repository contains my submission for the Behavioral Cloning Project of Udacity's Self-Driving Car NanoDegree.

Udacity provided a simulator where I could steer a car around a track for data collection. I used image data and steering angles to train a neural network and then used this model to drive the car autonomously around the track.

You can fid the detailed writeup of the project here.

The project submission has following files: 
* model.py (script used to read the training data and create/train the model)
* drive.py (script to drive the car - provided by Udacity)
* model.h5 (a trained Keras model)
* Markdown write up
* video.mp4 (a video recording of vehicle driving autonomously around the track at 60fps, captured for one full lap)
